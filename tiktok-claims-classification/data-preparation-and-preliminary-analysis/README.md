# Data Preparation and Preliminary Analysis

## Project Overview

The TikTok data team seeks to develop a machine learning model to assist in the classification of claims for user submissions. To begin, the data team needs to organize the raw dataset and prepare it for future exploratory data analysis.

## Project background

TikTokâ€™s data team is in the earliest stages of the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process.

### Your assignment involves:
1. Build a dataframe for the TikTok dataset.
2. Examine data type of each column.
3. Gather descriptive statistics.

## Key Insights
- There is a near equal balance of opinions versus claims. With this understanding, we can proceed with our future analysis knowing that there is a fairly balanced amount of claims and opinions for the videos included within this dataset.
- With the key variables identified and the initial investigation of the claims classification dataset, the process of exploratory data analysis can begin.
